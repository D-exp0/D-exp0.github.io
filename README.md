<summary>How to pronounce my name</summary>
  
Emphasis is placed in the highlighted syllables in each word: Dani<strong>el</strong> Ex<strong>pó</strong>sito Pa<strong>ti</strong>ño. Additionally, the letter ñ is pronounced as gn in french (champignon) or close to ny in english (canyon). Write \tilde{n} for typesetting ñ on LaTeX.

I am a master graduate from the [University of Copenhagen](https://geotop.math.ku.dk/), currently looking for a PhD. My interests are broad but intersect the fields of geometric
topology, higher algebra, algebraic K-theory and stable homotopy theory. I’m specially keen on geometric applications of algebraic machines.

My CV is available upon request. You can email me at   depa [at] di [dot] ku [dot] dk.

## Theses
<details open><summary><strong>Master thesis, <i>Classification of n-connective (2n-2)-truncated local systems</i> (University of Copenhagen, 2023)</strong> <a href="Classification of n-connective (2n-2)-truncated local systems .pdf">pdf</a></summary>
  Our main contribution is a result classifying generalized Eilenberg-MacLane spaces where we allow non-trivial homotopy groups in a band, instead of a single index: we proved that the truncated unreduced infinity suspension functor τ<sub>≤2n−2</sub>Σ<sup>∞</sup><sub>+</sub> provides an equivalence between the category of n-connective (2n-2)-truncated anima/homotopy types An<sup>[n,2n-2]</sup> and the category of spectral copoints, ie of maps to the truncated sphere of the form  τ<sub>≤2n−2</sub>Σ<sup>∞</sup><sub>+</sub> X ---> τ<sub>≤2n−2</sub> <strong>S</strong> , which are precisely the images through the mentioned functor of the unique map X ---> * for X in An<sup>[n,2n-2]</sup>. As a corollary, we classify local systems valued on An<sup>[n,2n-2]</sup>, generalizing the known result for k-gerbes - which are local systems valued on Eilenberg-MacLane spaces. This is a new result that we believe could help develop the theory of dethomification. Publication is pending.

<details><summary><strong>Bachelor thesis, <i>Classification of compact surfaces using surgery</i> (University of Santiago de Compostela, 2021)</strong> <a href="Clasificación das superficies compactas por cirurxía.pdf">pdf</a></summary>
  (Language: galician) The focus of the project was reproving the classification of surfaces theorem using a surgery argument by Zeeman. With group actions on the hyperbolic plane and glueing we present models for each homeo type of surface, we show that C1 surfaces are triangulable using an idea of Weil involving riemannian methods, we define handles and show the different glueing orientations and lastly prove the theorem using surgery techniques and euler characteristic considerations.

## Projects and notes
<details><summary><strong>A map for infinity-categories' explorers (2024) </strong> <a href="Map.pdf">pdf</a>, under construction</summary>
  A schematic recounting of what ∞-categories are, some of the key areas they unlock and interesting applications of higher algebraic concepts. Priority is given to showing varied aspects of the theory while trying to stay short and accesible, as the excuse for this project is to explain it to my brother, but hopefully it's useful for others, too.

<details><summary><strong>Six Functor Formalisms (early 2023) </strong> <a href="5. Daniel, Six functor formalism.pdf">pdf</a></summary>
  Notes from a talk I gave as part of the course <a href="https://kurser.ku.dk/course/nmak15023u">Topics in Algebraic Topology</a> at KU. Primarily based on an article by Lucas Mann and lecture notes by Peter Scholze. I received guidance from Quinyuan Bai and Lars Hesselholt for the production of the notes.

<details><summary><strong>The s-cobordism Theorem and Surgery Theory (2022) </strong><a href="Surgery.pdf">pdf</a></summary>
  Our main reference was the book on surgery theory by Wolfgang Lück and Tibor Macko. We began with some morse theory and handle decompositions, studied CW structures and a variety of lemmas for cancelling and rearranging handles. We delved into K(ZG) and various definitions for the Whitehead group, whitehead torsion and Reidemeister torsion. Afterwards we proved the s-cobordism theorem and used it to show the Poincaré conjecture for dim bigger than 5. Grade 12/12, exam was a 40 min presentation.

<details><summary><strong>The Pontryagin-Thom Isomorphism (2022) </strong> <a href="Pontryagin-Thom slides.pdf">pdf</a> </summary>
  My first hands on approximation to ∞-categories. We recalled the theory of vector bundles, introduced spectra and delved into Thom spaces. Here we related the classical definition and the ∞-categorical one from Ando-Blumberg-Gepner-Hopkins-Rezk, talked about the J-homomorphism and Thom spectra and proved the Thom isomorphism, which we used to compute H<sub>*</sub>(MU). On the last chapter we defined theta structures and proved the Pontryagin-Thom isomorphism, using it to calculate the cobordism ring with an almost complex structure thanks to H<sub>*</sub>(MU) and an degenerate Adams sseq. Grade 12/12, exam was a 1h15 presentation. <a href="PTiso.pdf">Incomplete notes</a>

## Teaching 
Teacher Assistant positions I held at the University of Copenhagen, department of Computer Science. Responsabilities included holding exercise classes, creating exercise sheets (IDS), assisting students and grading assignments.

- Introduction to Data Science [block 3, spring semester 23-24] [(IDS)](https://kurser.ku.dk/course/ndak16003u)

  > The purpose of the course is to introduce non-Computer Science students to probabilistic data modelling and the most common techniques from statistical machine learning and data mining. The students will obtain a working knowledge of basic data modelling and data analysis using fundamental machine learning techniques. 

- Modelling and Analysis of Data [block 2, winter semester 22-23] [(MAD)](https://kurser.ku.dk/course/ndab16012u)

  > The purpose of the course is to provide a basic and broad introduction to the representation, analysis, and processing of sampled data. The course will introduce the student to statistical analysis, mathematical modelling, machine learning and visualisation for experimental data. Examples will be taken from real-world problems, such as analysis of internet traffic, language technology, digital sound and image processing, etc.

- Mathematical Analysis and Probability Theory for Computer Scientists [block 1, winter semester 22-23] [(MASD)](https://kurser.ku.dk/course/NDAB18002U)
  
  > The course provides an introduction to analysis in one and more variables. The course also provides an introduction to probability theory.

## Miscellanea 
<details open> <summary><strong>Online course on Topological Data Analysis, organized by the Spanish Topology Network, 2024</strong></summary>
It included talks by Vidit Nanda explaining persistence modules, barcodes and the stability theorem; by Robert Ghrist on euler & persistence homology transforms, space reconstruction and cellular cosheaves for distributed systems and by Bastian Rieck on topological machine learning, topological autoencoders and graph learning applications. Additionally, Aina Ferrà and Rubén Ballester (PhD students in Barcelona) showed TDA implementations with emphasis on Gudhi and Ripster.

<details open><summary><strong>Short research project supervised by Nathalie Wahl (block 4, 2024, KU)</strong></summary>
  On homological stability of mapping class groups of non-orientable surfaces. We were trying to adapt the strategy of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03858">Harr-Vistrup-Wahl</a> of using Yang-Baxter elements to get a E1-module over the braid group structure on a certain category of bidecorated surfaces, which would allow us to access a homological stability result by Krannich. Time run out while trying to prove connectivity of a modified arc complex, thus we didn't reach the desired result. Still, I got to learn about the current research on the topic.
